# Apache Flink Playgrounds

This repository provides playgrounds to quickly and easily explore [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org)'s features.

The playgrounds are based on [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environments.
Each subfolder of this repository contains the docker-compose setup of a playground, except for the `./docker` folder which contains code and configuration to build custom Docker images for the playgrounds.

## Available Playgrounds

Currently, the following playgrounds are available:

* The **Flink Operations Playground** in the (`operations-playground` folder) lets you explore and play with Flink's features to manage and operate stream processing jobs. You can witness how Flink recovers a job from a failure, upgrade and rescale a job, and query job metrics. The playground consists of a Flink cluster, a Kafka cluster and an example 
Flink job. The playground is presented in detail in the
["Getting Started" guide](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/getting-started/docker-playgrounds/flink-operations-playground.html) of Flink's documentation.

* The interactive SQL playground is still under development and will be added shortly.
